# Nail Couture

This project involved the creation of a complete website focused on manicure, pedicure, and nail art, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a modern, attractive, and functional design.

Technologies used:

- HTML: The entire content was structured, including sections such as Hero, Offers & News, Services (with cards for each service), Meet the Team, Reviews, Newsletter, Location Map, along with the FAQ and Contact pages. Each section was carefully designed to ensure smooth navigation and accessible information.

- CSS: Was used to style each section, distinguishing them with unique backgrounds, vibrant colors, and appealing typography. Special effects were added, such as cloud-like transitions between sections, as well as smooth animations on scroll. Each part of the site was centered and organized to ensure visually pleasing content on any device.

- JavaScript: was used for interactive functionalities, like revealing answers in the FAQ (with a toggle effect for questions and answers), as well as form validation on the Contact page. The project also includes animated effects in sections, such as scroll-triggered transitions of visual elements.

This project applied advanced concepts of responsive design, CSS animations, and JavaScript interactivity, resulting in a highly visual, functional, and professionally ready website.
